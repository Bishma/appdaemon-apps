# AppDaemon Apps

My slightly dysfunctional AppDaemon Apps.

# alexa.py

An alexa API backend

# roku_channels.md

* Gets the current channel list from our Roku and writes it to an input_select helper in home assistant.
* When the input_select changes selected value, change the roku's channel

# media_activity.md

Sets our media center to specific states for specific activities. A so-so replacement for our logitech harmony hub (RIP).
